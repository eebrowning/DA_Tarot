GOALS: 
Multi-step form with step-by-step frontend validators, combined with backend validators.

Animated 'baseball card'



MAYBE Dragon age character cards with classes instead of sport





Stretch:
users, interactive
ro-sham-bo w/ classes? 
accounts can store experience for each of their cards/heroes.
class ties can be broken with a level difference


choose card / icon with class selection? 

animate it like the opening character creator like in DAI
