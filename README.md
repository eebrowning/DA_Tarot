GOALS: 
Currently a single-CRUD MERN app, in the middle of adjusting it to be a card-creator
themed for the Dragon Age franchise.
At the moment, there is no live site to demo, but I have the main card carousel completed,
and a fully validated front-end form with bootstrap, as well as backend validations to avoid bad data injections.


Stretch:
users, interactive
Rock-Paper-Scissors (Warrior-Mage-Rogue)
accounts can store experience for each of their cards/heroes.
class ties can be broken with a level difference


animate it like the opening character creator like in Dragon Age: Inquisition
