STORY:
I was building a small app for practice, and had the idea to pivot from baseball-card-styled athlete cards, and got bored with it, as I'm more of a fantasy nerd--SO, it's now a card database for Dragon Age characters!!!!!!


TODO: a better README

Node.js / Express.js: Node.js is a powerful and efficient server-side JavaScript runtime that is used to build scalable and high-performance applications. Express.js is a popular web framework for Node.js that provides a simple and intuitive API for building web applications.

AWS S3 uploads: Amazon S3 is a cloud-based storage service that provides a reliable and scalable way to store and retrieve data. In this application, S3 is used to upload and manage files such as images and other media.

Passport for auth: Passport is a popular authentication middleware for Node.js that provides a flexible and modular way to authenticate users in web applications. It supports various authentication strategies such as local authentication, OAuth, and more.

MongoDB: MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that is used to store and manage data in this application. It provides a flexible and scalable way to store and query data, and is widely used in modern web applications.

-- Frontend
React.js: React is a popular frontend JavaScript library that is used to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces. It provides a component-based architecture that makes it easy to build and maintain complex UIs.

Redux: Redux is a popular state management library for React that provides a predictable and centralized way to manage application state. It makes it easy to share data between different components and to handle complex data flows.

Bootstrap form validation: Bootstrap is a popular frontend framework that provides a set of pre-built UI components and styles. In this application, Bootstrap is used to provide form validation and other UI enhancements.

Overall, this tech stack provides a solid foundation for building modern and scalable web applications. With its combination of backend and frontend technologies, this application is well-suited for a wide range of use cases and can be easily extended and customized as needed.
  



Stretch:
user interactivity
Rock-Paper-Scissors (Warrior-Mage-Rogue, Tarot-sham-bo?) w/ situational bonuses based on race or faction
accounts can store experience for each of their cards/heroes.
class ties can be broken with a level difference


animate it like the opening character creator like in Dragon Age: Inquisition
