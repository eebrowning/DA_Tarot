STORY:
I was building a small app for practice, and had the idea to pivot from baseball-card-styled athlete cards, and got bored with it, as I'm more of a fantasy nerd--SO, it's now a card database for Dragon Age characters!!!!!!


GOALS: 
Currently a single-CRUD MERN app, in the middle of adjusting it to be a card-creator
themed for the Dragon Age franchise.
At the moment, there is no live site to demo, but I have the main card carousel completed,
and a fully validated front-end form with bootstrap, as well as backend validations to avoid bad data injections.



Stretch:
user interactivity
Rock-Paper-Scissors (Warrior-Mage-Rogue, Tarot-sham-bo?) w/ situational bonuses based on race or faction
accounts can store experience for each of their cards/heroes.
class ties can be broken with a level difference


animate it like the opening character creator like in Dragon Age: Inquisition
